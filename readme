## **Getting Ready**

---

1. You have **60 minutes** to complete the test
2. We will take **5 minutes** to review the result
3. You can use any tools you like (Google, Stack Overflow, documentation, etc.)
4. You are strongly encouraged to use AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot to code faster
5. You can use additional libraries and reference existing code that you may have.
6. It’s okay to be silent during the test, or feel free to talk - whatever you’re comfortable with

## **Task**

Build a Node.js application that will fetch data from external sources and then outputs the received data upon request.

1. Create a service that gets data from the endpoints below
   1. [Posts](https://www.scalablepath.com/api/test/test-posts)
   2. [Comments](https://www.scalablepath.com/api/test/test-comments)
2. Store the fetched data in a table for each of the resources.
3. Create a **/posts** endpoint that returns a list of all the posts
4. Create another endpoint **/posts/{post_id}/comments** and return all comments from the specified post.
5. Create an endpoint to _soft_ delete posts by a given id.
6. Create an endpoint that allows moving a specific comment from one post to another.
7. Create an endpoint to add a new comment to a post
8. Write tests for the app

## **Considerations**

- You **must** use TypeScript.
- You **must** use NestJS or Express.

## **Bonus Tasks**

1. Implement a cache layer
2. Use Docker
